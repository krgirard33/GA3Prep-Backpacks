// Let's start with an empty backpack object
let backpack = {};

// TODO: Set 3 compartments inside backpack - main, front, and side. Everything should be empty for now.


// TODO: Run the program to verify your object has the intended keys and values (there's a console.log at the end of the file already).

// TODO: Create several item objects!
// textbook - put in main compartment

// pen - put in front pocket

// water bottle - put in side pocket

// iPhone - put in front pocket

// notebook - no location yet

// pencil - put in front pocket


// TODO: Write a function to add one item to the correct location of the backpack. If the location is unknown, set it to be in the main compartment.


// TODO: Create an array that holds all four items. (This will simulate the way data is often received from a database via an API.)


// TODO: Use a loop to put each item into the backpack using the function you wrote. After each is added, use a template literal to print "The (name) was added to the (location) of the backpack."


// TODO: Loop through the backpack and print each item in each compartment


// Take a look at the entire contents of the backpack so you see the nested data structures!
console.log("\nHere is the entire backpack object:");
console.log(backpack);

// Great job!
